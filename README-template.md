### What I learned

Up until now i didn't really know how to create this interactive slide bar as it was my first time creating something like that. It was ceratinly nice learning about this, especially in vanilla javascript (since until now i've relied a bit too much in react). 

I also learned how to create a toggle switch and use the selectors "::before" and "::after".
